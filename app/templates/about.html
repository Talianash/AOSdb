            <h1>About the database</h1>
            <p>We performed the search for ATP synthase subunit sequences in a set of 711 fully sequenced genomes of archaea and bacteria used in the latest version of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) database [1]. Sequences of mitochondrial (bovine and baker's yeast) and chloroplast (spinach) enzymes were also added to the database. Hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles were constructed according to the latest version of the COG database as described in [2] and were taken for database search using the HMMscan 3.1 software from the HMMer3 package [3]. Since the results of HMM profile-based search often contained evolutionarily related proteins (e.g. α subunits while using β subunit profile), we sorted the results by E-value. For β-subunit, the hits with E-value higher than 7.7×10-103 were cut off, since a jump in E-values was observed after this threshold, separating β-subunits from the related ones. Similar procedure was performed for all remaining FOF1 subunits. The obtained sets of subunits were divided into potentially belonging to ATP synthases of N-type or F-type. Operons containing all the F1 and FO subunits except δ subunit were considered N-type.
